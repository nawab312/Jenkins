**Imagine you're working on a microservices-based application where multiple teams are responsible for different services. Each service is deployed independently, but there’s a central orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to manage the deployments. You are tasked with setting up a CI/CD pipeline for one of these services. However, the challenge is that this service has a high number of dependencies on other services in the system, and some of these services might not be available for integration testing during the CI pipeline run. Question: How would you design the CI/CD pipeline to handle integration testing in this scenario, where some services might be down, while ensuring that the pipeline is still fast, reliable, and doesn’t block deployments?**

Key Points to Consider:
- Managing dependencies between services.
- Handling service unavailability during testing.
- Ensuring reliability and speed of the pipeline.
- Potential use of mocks or stubs for unavailable services.

- You have a microservice called `OrderService` that depends on an external service called `InventoryService`. Sometimes the `InventoryService` is unavailable, so the pipeline should continue but handle service unavailability gracefully by using mock responses.
- The `OrderService` is a Java-based microservice.
- The pipeline should run **Unit Tests**, **Integration Tests**, and then deploy to a **staging environment**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        ORDER_SERVICE_NAME = 'OrderService'
        INVENTORY_SERVICE_NAME = 'Inventory'
        DEPLOYMENT_ENV = 'staging'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm //Checkout the source code from Git
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'mvn clean install' //Build the OrderService
                }                
            }
        }
        stage('Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'mvn test' // Run Unit Tests for the OrderService                   
                }                
            }
        }
        stage('Start Dependency Service') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Use Docker compose to Spin up InventorService (Or Necessary Services)
                    sh 'docker-compose up -d inventory-service'
                    // Alternatively, mock InventoryService using WireMock (only if needed)
                    sh 'docker-compose up -d wiremock'
                }                
            }
        }
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Check if Inventory Service is Running
                    try {
                        sh 'mvn verify' // Run Integration Test
                    } catch(Exception e) {
                        // If the InventoryService is Down Mock the Response
                        echo 'InventoryService is unavailable. Running tests with mock responses.'

                        // Here, you can use a mocking library like WireMock
                        // Simulate InventoryService responses in the tests
                        sh 'mvn -DmockInventoryService=true verify'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Stop Dependency Services') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'docket-compose down'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Staging') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh './deploy-to-staging.sh'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Noitfy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echo 'Sending Notification'
                    slackSend channel: '#devops', message: "Deployment finished for ${ORDER_SERVICE_NAME}"
                }

            success {
                echo 'Pipeline successfully completed'
            }
            failure {

- **Checkout Stage:** This pulls the latest code from the repository (Git or another source control system).
- **Build Stage:** In this example, we’re using Maven to build the `OrderService`. The command `mvn clean install` will clean the build and compile the code.
- **Unit Tests:** Run unit tests to ensure the codebase is correct. This is done via mvn test.
- **Start Dependency Services:** Here, we use **Docker Compose** to bring up the `InventoryService` as a dependency. This is useful when the service is available for testing. If the `InventoryService` is unavailable, you can mock it using **WireMock** or another mock tool.
- **Integration Tests:** These tests run the actual integration tests where `OrderService` communicates with `InventoryService`. If `InventoryService` is unavailable, the pipeline continues by mocking the service responses (you can implement mocking using tools like WireMock or mock classes in the codebase).
- **Stop Dependency Services:** After the tests are complete, the pipeline stops the services (both real and mock) to clean up the environment.
